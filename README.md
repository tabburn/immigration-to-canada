# Immigration to Canada EDA & Data Visualization
This analysis uses a [dataset](https://github.com/tabburn/Portfolio/blob/main/Immigration%20to%20Canada%20EDA/resources/Canada.xlsx) that records the inflow of immigrants into Canada from all over the world from 1980 to 2013 and is used to identify patterns and trends. A [JSON file](https://github.com/tabburn/Portfolio/blob/main/Immigration%20to%20Canada%20EDA/resources/world_countries.json) is used at the end of the analysis in conjuction with Folium to produce a choropleth map.

> Folium maps do not render on GitHub natively. You can get a full dynamic output of the data analysis, including the choropleth map seen at the end of the analysis,  when the .ipynb file is viewed through nb.viewer.org linked [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/tabburn/immigration-to-canada/blob/main/data-analysis-and-viz.ipynb).

## Summary
The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize trends and patterns of immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013. Through this analysis we are able to answer questions like:
* How many countries contributed to immigration to Canada?
* What is the total number of immigrants from 1980 to 2013?
* Which countries contributed more to immigration?
* What is the overall migration trend during this timeframe?
* What is the predicted number of immigrants for a specific year?
